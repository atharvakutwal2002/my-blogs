First of all I want to thank all of you. My previous article blew off thanks to all of you and I hope you will keep supporting me with your likeness for my articles in future. So now lets get to the article.

So you have learnt React Js basics. Now what next? Here are the three things, you should learn one of them after you had learnt React Js basics.

## 1. Auth0

Auth0 is basically an authentication and authorization program for your React Js application. It provides all the tools necessary to build and run a secure identity infrastructure including authentication, data protection, and password management.

You will need to implement some type of authentication program in your application when a user logs in. Auth0 is very helpful in this case. You can easily download and implement it.

## 2. Axios or AJAX

Axios is a library for React Js that is used to implement AJAX in your applications. AJAX is used to fetch or give data to APIs, Databases or any other data storing technologies.

You will need Axios to implement AJAX which you will need for sign up and login, displaying or using data from APIs. In short, you will need it in most of your projects or applications.

## 3. React Router

React Router is a powerful library that helps to implement routing in React Js applications. In normal JavaScript we can go to a webpage by using anchor ( <a> ) tag. However, because JavaScript is not written inside HTML instead HTML is written inside JavaScript in React Js, we need another way of travelling between webpages or Components in React Js

Here comes the React Router to rescue. It provides a way to travel or redirect from one Component to another Component in React Js. It will be important to learn if you want to make a website ( website is the collection of webpages linked together ) with React Js.
